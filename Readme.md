# Draft of readme

I’ve finished a large AI project based on the text of Buddhist sutras. Well, “finished” is relative — documentation still needs to be written. 

In this project, I built a **web application with a RAG system** for search and question answering across the entire corpus of Buddhist sutras (in English translation). If you’re interested in answers to questions like **“What is the Buddha?”**, feel free to consult my AI.

Link to the question form:
**[SuttaPitaka](http://35.208.69.174/suttapitaka/)**

### Comments

The limitation is approximately **one request per minute**. This limitation exists because the project is free. The project will stay online as long as I have the money to pay for the virtual machine and the tokens (or until I win some kind of small grant for it).

My wife really liked asking the question: **“Can a woman become an Arahant?”** — so it has now become the test question for model validation.
